## Description<a id='description'></a>
Create a back end to support an existing e-commerce site.  Sequelize is used in place of native SQL and tables are built based on the definitions and associations from models.  The terminal command npm i should be run on first use to create node_modules and package-lock.json.  Next open the MySQL shell terminal and run source db/schema.sql to delete and previous database with naming conflict and establish and use the new database.  Finally, run npm start from the bash terminal to get the server up and running.


## Installation<a id='installation'></a>
See description.



## Usage Information<a id='usageInfo'></a>
Routes can be tested in Insomnia as there is currently no front end.  Insomnia routes are not pushed to GitHub as part of the reposition and so would need to be recreated.  For example, once the server is running, you can use http://localhost:3001/api/categories to view all categories.  Other routes follow industry standard syntax for route directories and parameters.  Some require a JSON body that will vary depending on the model being posted/updated to.  



## How To Contribute<a id='contribute'></a>
No contributions anticipated.  



## Testing Instructions<a id='testInstr'></a>
Testing is completed within Insomnia.
